Do "$ARGUMENTS" part of the plan. IMPORTANT! Don't do other parts of the plan.

## When finished code changes

- Mark relevant action points done in the plan file.
- Update the plan file with concise summary of what's done. IMPORTANT! Keep plan file concise and clear: replace or remove info which became obsolete.
- In all avon-ai/\* folders where we made changes (but ignore \_plans folder!), check if we are NOT on main branch and on some "yuri/AVO-nnn" branch. And if so, make there commits with very short message describing the changes made.

IMPORTANT! If you are not sure about something, ask me first. I will help you to understand.
